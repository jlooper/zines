# MaZine Learning with Professor Puff!

Enjoy learning about Machine Learning topics with little free printable 'zines. They are available in 'drops' of 5 zines at a time as I complete them.

I create these using Procreate. I hope you enjoy the illustrations and that they make you think in new ways about ML.

What's a zine? It's a handmade, printable paper that you fold into a small magazine. They allow folks to discuss topics in a novel, visual way. These printables are available freely online at https://zines.jenlooper.com. Enjoy, and tell me what you think in the issues tab!
